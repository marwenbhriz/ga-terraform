# Automated Infrastructure Deployment on Google Cloud Platform with Terraform and GitHub Actions

> Note: This setup combines the infrastructure-as-code approach of Terraform with the automation capabilities of GitHub Actions, streamlining the process of managing and deploying infrastructure on GCP.

## Objective

Building infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform and GitHub Actions enables automated provisioning and management of cloud resources. Terraform defines infrastructure as code, specifying GCP resources like VMs, databases, and networking. GitHub Actions automates Terraform workflows, ensuring consistent deployments, version control integration, and collaborative development practices.

## Prerequisites

List the prerequisites for running the project, such as:

Google Cloud Platform Account: You need a GCP account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.
Terraform: Install Terraform on your local machine or CI/CD environment. Refer to Terraform Installation Guide for instructions.
GitHub Actions: Familiarity with setting up GitHub Actions workflows. Refer to GitHub Actions Documentation for more details.
